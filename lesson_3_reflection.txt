When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -When you would like to share your work or collaborate with others.
  -When you would like your work to be accessable from multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -Working on files being accessed by others, would require an automatic "pull merge" - likely to be very annoying.
